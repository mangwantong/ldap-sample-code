## Project Description ##

The **ldap-sample-code** project houses sample code written for use in demonstrating aspects of LDAP, best practices with LDAP, and the [UnboundID LDAP SDK](http://www.unboundid.com/products/ldap-sdk/). The sample code is often used to provide examples and demonstrations at the [LDAP Blog](http://ff1959.wordpress.com) and references to code in that blog refer to code hosted in this project.
